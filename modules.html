      Modules
    </h1>
    <p style="font-family: 'Sarabun';">
      Welcome to my <strong>Modules</strong>, here you'll see a list and descriptions of the 10 modules 
      I decided to chose.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Intro To HTML/CSS
    </h3>
        <p   
      style="font-family: 'Sarabun';">
       The first Module I have is my intro to HTML/CSS, this module helped me a lot as a student 
        as it helped me learn how to make aesthetically pleasing webpages. It also taught me how to 
          insert images and links into my webpages. I'll continue to use this the same way I've 
          used it throughout the course, it helped me with my hackathon project when I made my
          webpage. During future assignments I'll use what I learned during intro to HTML and CSS 
          to help me.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Intro to JS
    </h3>
           <p   
      style="font-family: 'Sarabun';">
      The introduction to JS was useful for me as a student because it taught me how to create and edit
      objects. I learned how to interact with the objects so when I clicked the mouse they'd do something.
      I used this throughout the course and I'll continue to use it in basically every coding project I do.
      It was useful for me during my live coding challenge throught basically the entire thing and also throughout
      my hackathon when I needed to learn how to make a calculator.
             
    </p>
    <h3>
      Natural Simulations
    </h3>
            <p   
      style="font-family: 'Sarabun';">
      Out of the first 4 modules you'll read about natural simulations might've been the most fun to work with.
      This is because making it so your objects will interact with things on the screen without you doing anything
      is just so satisfying when it works. Another reason is because I've also never really done this before with
      objects so I found that cool aswell. I used this throughout many projects but especially in projects where you 
      have to make a game I'll continue to use it more and more, finally I think that in my live coding challenge is
      where this was the most useful.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Games and Visualizations
    </h3>
            <p   
      style="font-family: 'Sarabun';">
      Games and visualizations helped me learn how to tweak certain things about the games I was given a chance to edit.
      One thing I think that I could've benefitted from in this section would've been to have to actually create most 
      of the game instead of just editing one or two things. Still it was very helpful when I had to do my object oriented
      refactorings for my live coding challenge project because I already knew how to do certain things. I will continue to
      use this throughout games that I make in the future.
    </p>
    <h3>
      My Live Coding Challenge (Space Invaders)
    </h3>
           <p
      style="font-family: 'Sarabun';">
      My live coding challenge taught me a lot as a student but the main thing I learned was how to make a game look real.
      This was because I had never made a game that looked legit before, it was usually just a bunch of triangles or 
      squares never something that looked real. I changed space invaders a ton and made it look real. I also sort of 
      learned how to do object oriented refactoring a lot better during this coding module. I'll continue to use
      this every time I have to change certain small things about a program to make it look nicer. 
    </p>
    <h3>
      Peer Live Coding Challenge (Flappy Bird)
    </h3>
           <p
      style="font-family: 'Sarabun';"        >
      During the peer coding challenge I learned a lot but the one I found the most interesting and useful was flappy
      bird, this is probably because I had the easiest time understanding what each thing did. What I learned from this
      module was how to create a moving screen. In my own coding challenge I didn't have to do this and I've never done
      it before. I think I'll end up having to use it at some point when making a game so it'll definitely be 
      useful for me in the future.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Hackathon Webpage
    </h3>
           <p
      style="font-family: 'Sarabun';"        >
      The Hackathon taught me a lot about creating a webpage. I used everything I learned from the intro to HTML/CSS
      and the intro to JS aswell. This is because it was my first time making a webpage like this out of these
      languages so I had to learn as I went along. In terms of how important each module was in terms of getting me 
      used to the coding languages this is probably the most important. I am going to use what I learned in this
      module as I continue to code and create more webpages.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Creating Coding Session (Computation art Show)
    </h3>
           <p
      style="font-family: 'Sarabun';"        >
      During this module I learned all about the p5 editor. That helped me a ton and it also helped me learn how
      to implement all of CSS JS and HTML into one single program. I used what I learned during this for literally 
      every other module I did throughout the course. Creating new slides/new screens was also something I learned
      during the computation art show and I think as I continue to use CSS JS and HTML and also the p5 editor 
      I'll use what I learned during this creative coding session.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Computer Science Principles: Programming
    </h3>
           <p
      style="font-family: 'Sarabun';"        >
      At the start of the course we had to go through this to kind of learn about the programming we'd be doing
      throughout the course. It helped a ton, I learned the basics of computer science and programming which
      helped me with the basics of when we actually had to start coding big programs and do fairly big assignments.
      I'm probably going to keep using the basics of computer science that this taught me throughout any more computer
      courses I take ever or just in my daily life throughout the future.
